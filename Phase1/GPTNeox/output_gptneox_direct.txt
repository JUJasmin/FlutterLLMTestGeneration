Write a Flutter widget test for the following widget from the Flutter Testing App sample:

```dart
class ProfileAvatar extends StatelessWidget {
  final String imageUrl;
  const ProfileAvatar({required this.imageUrl, super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return CircleAvatar(
      backgroundImage: NetworkImage(imageUrl),
    );
  }
}
